<h2> Where am I from? </h2>
<p>I was born in a small island found between the middle of the North Atlactic Ocean and the Caribean Sea. I am from an island divided in two. Where the palms fly high and the sun shines bright. I am from a place where people are constatly smiling, dancing and eating. I am from the Dominican Republic.
</p>
<h2> My Journey</h2>
<p> I immigrated to the US at the age of 4 with my mom,dad and older sister, all to achieve the american dream. I have lived in both Boston and Florida. This has allowed me to build many bonds with different people. I am able to call all three places my home.   </p>
